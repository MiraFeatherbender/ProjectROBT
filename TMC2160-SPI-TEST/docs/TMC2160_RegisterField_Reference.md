<details>
<summary><b>GLOBAL_SCALER (0x0B)</b></summary>
R/W: Write | Bits: 8

- **TMC2160_GLOBAL_SCALER_FIELD**:  
  Global scaling of Motor current. This value is multiplied to the current scaling in order to adapt a drive to a certain motor type. This value should be chosen before tuning other settings, because it also influences chopper hysteresis.

R/W: Write | Bits: 5 (IHOLD) + 5 (IRUN) + 4 (IHOLDDELAY)

- **TMC2160_IHOLD_FIELD**:

<details>
<summary><b>TPOWERDOWN (0x11)</b></summary>

  0...((2^8)-1) * 2^18 t_CLK

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>TSTEP (0x12)</b></summary>
R/W: Write | Bits: 20

- **TMC2160_TSTEP_FIELD**:  
  Actual measured time between two 1/256 microsteps derived from the step input frequency in units of 1/fCLK. Measured value is (2^20)-1 in case of overflow or stand still.  
  All TSTEP related thresholds use a hysteresis of 1/16 of the compare value to compensate for jitter in the clock or the step frequency. The flag _small_hysteresis_ modifies the hysteresis to a smaller value of 1/32.  
  (Txxx*15/16)-1 or (Txxx*31/32)-1 is used as a second compare value for each comparison value.  
  This means, that the lower switching velocity equals the calculated setting, but the upper switching velocity is higher as defined by the hysteresis setting.  
  In dcStep mode TSTEP will not show the mean velocity of the motor, but the velocities for each microstep, which may not be stable and thus does not represent the real motor velocity in case it runs slower than the target velocity.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>TPWMTHRS (0x13)</b></summary>
R/W: Write | Bits: 20

- **TMC2160_TPWMTHRS_FIELD**:  
  This is the upper velocity for stealthChop voltage PWM mode.  
  TSTEP ≥ TPWMTHRS  
  - stealthChop PWM mode is enabled, if configured  
  - dcStep is disabled

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>TCOOLTHRS (0x14)</b></summary>
R/W: Write | Bits: 20

- **TMC2160_TCOOLTHRS_FIELD**:  
  This is the lower threshold velocity for switching on smart energy coolStep and stallGuard feature (unsigned).  
  Set this parameter to disable coolStep at low speeds, where it cannot work reliably. The stop on stall function (enable with sg_stop when using internal motion controller) and the stall output signal become enabled when exceeding this velocity. In non-dcStep mode, it becomes disabled again once the velocity falls below this threshold.  
  TCOOLTHRS ≥ TSTEP ≥ THIGH:  
  - coolStep is enabled, if configured  
  - stealthChop voltage PWM mode is disabled  
  TCOOLTHRS ≥ TSTEP  
  - Stop on stall is enabled, if configured  
  - Stall output signal (DIAG0/1) is enabled, if configured

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>THIGH (0x15)</b></summary>
R/W: Write | Bits: 20

- **TMC2160_THIGH_FIELD**:  
  This velocity setting allows velocity dependent switching into a different chopper mode and fullstepping to maximize torque (unsigned). The stall detection feature becomes switched off for 2-3 electrical periods whenever passing THIGH threshold to compensate for the effect of switching modes.  
  TSTEP ≤ THIGH:  
  - coolStep is disabled (motor runs with normal current scale)  
  - stealthChop voltage PWM mode is disabled  
  - If vhighchm is set, the chopper switches to chm=1 with TFD=0 (constant off time with slow decay, only).  
  - If vhighfs is set, the motor operates in fullstep mode and the stall detection becomes switched over to dcStep stall detection.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>XDIRECT (0x2D)</b></summary>
R/W: Read/Write | Bits: 9 (coil A current) + 9 (coil B current)

- **TMC2160_XDIRECT_FIELD**:  
  This register is used in direct coil current mode, only (direct_mode = 1). It bypasses the internal sequencer. Specifies signed coil A current (bits 8..0) and coil B current (bits 24..16). In this mode, the current is scaled by IHOLD setting. Velocity based current regulation of stealthChop is not available in this mode. The automatic stealthChop current regulation will work only for low stepper motor velocities.  
  2x -255...+255

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>VDCMIN (0x33)</b></summary>
R/W: Write | Bits: 23 (bits 0–22; only bits 22–8 used for value/comparison)

- **TMC2160_VDCMIN_FIELD**:  
  Automatic commutation dcStep minimum velocity. Enable dcStep by DCEN pin.  
  In this mode, the actual position is determined by the sensorless motor commutation and becomes fed back to the external motion controller. In case the motor becomes heavily loaded, VDCMIN is used as the minimum step velocity.  
  _Hint:_ Also set DCCTRL parameters in order to operate dcStep.  
  (Only bits 22...8 are used for value and for comparison)

  High velocity chopper mode. This bit enables switching to chm=1 and fd=0, when VHIGH is exceeded. This way, a higher velocity can be achieved. Can be combined with vhighfs=1. If set, the TOFF setting automatically becomes doubled during high velocity operation in order to avoid doubling of the chopper frequency.
- **TMC2160_VHIGHFS_FIELD**:  
  High velocity fullstep selection. This bit enables switching to fullstep, when VHIGH is exceeded. Switching takes place only at 45° position. The fullstep target current uses the current value from the microstep table at the 45° position.

  OFFSET: Sine wave offset. %0000 ... %1111: Offset is -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, ..., 12. This is the sine wave offset and 1/512 of the value becomes added to the absolute value of each sine wave entry.
- **TMC2160_HSTRT_FIELD**:  
  HSTRT: Hysteresis start value added to HEND. %000 ... %111: Add 1, 2, ..., 8 to hysteresis low value HEND (1/512 of this setting adds to current setting). **Attention:** Effective HEND+HSTRT ≤ 16. _Hint:_ Hysteresis decrement is done each 16 clocks.
- **TMC2160_VSENSE_FIELD**:  
  **Bit 17 (Reserved):** Set to 0. This bit is reserved in TMC2160 and must remain cleared for proper operation.
- **TMC2160_TFD_FIELD**:  
  TFD [2..0]: Fast decay time setting. chm=1: Fast decay time setting %0000 ... %1111: Fast decay time setting TFD with Nclk=32*TFD (%0000: slow decay only).
- **TMC2160_TOFF_FIELD**:  
  TOFF off time and driver enable. Off time setting controls duration of slow decay phase Nclk=12 + 32*TOFF. %0000: Driver disable, all bridges off. %0001: 1 – use only with TBL ≥ 2. %0010 ... %1111: 2 ... 15.

  stallGuard2 filter enable. 0: Standard mode, high time resolution for stallGuard2. 1: Filtered mode, stallGuard2 signal updated for each four fullsteps (resp. six fullsteps for 3 phase motor) only to compensate for motor pole tolerances.
- **TMC2160_SGT_FIELD**:  
  stallGuard2 threshold value. This signed value controls stallGuard2 level for stall output and sets the optimum measurement range for readout. A lower value gives a higher sensitivity. Zero is the starting value working with most motors. -64 to +63: A higher value makes stallGuard2 less sensitive and requires more torque to indicate a stall.
- **TMC2160_SEIMIN_FIELD**:  
  minimum current for smart current control. 0: 1/2 of current setting (IRUN), 1: 1/4 of current setting (IRUN).

- **TMC2160_SEUP_FIELD**:  
  current up step width. Current increment steps per measured stallGuard2 value. %00 ... %11: 1, 2, 4, 8.
- **TMC2160_SEMIN_FIELD**:

  Set slightly higher than DC_TIME16

  stallGuard2 result respectively PWM on time for coil A in standstill for motor temperature detection. Mechanical load measurement: The stallGuard2 result gives a means to measure mechanical motor load. A higher value means lower mechanical load. A value of 0 signals highest load. With optimum SGT setting, this is an indicator for a motor stall. The stall detection compares SG_RESULT to 0 in order to detect a stall. SG_RESULT is used as a base for coolStep operation, by comparing it to a programmable upper and a lower limit. It is not applicable in stealthChop mode. stallGuard2 works best with microstep operation or dcStep. Temperature measurement: In standstill, no stallGuard2 result can be obtained. SG_RESULT shows the chopper on-time for motor coil A instead. Move the motor to a determined microstep position at a certain current setting to get a rough estimation of motor temperature by a reading the chopper on-time. As the motor heats up, its coil resistance rises, resulting in longer chopper on-time intervals.
