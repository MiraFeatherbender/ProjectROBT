# TMC2160 Troubleshooting Checklist

A modular checklist for error flags, configuration issues, and workflow validation.

---

## Error Flag Checklist

- Check `DRV_STATUS` for:
  - `otpw`, `ot` (overtemperature)
  - `stallGuard` (stall detection)
  - `s2ga`, `s2gb` (short to ground)
  - `olb`, `ola` (open load)

## Configuration Validation

- Verify `CHOPCONF` settings for:
  - Microstep resolution (`MRES`)
  - Decay (`TOFF`, `TPFD`)
  - Hysteresis (`HEND`, `HSTRT`)
- Ensure `IHOLD_IRUN` and `TPOWERDOWN` are set within recommended ranges.
- Cross-reference workflow steps with register values.

## Calibration & Tuning Issues

- For calibration issues:
  - Re-run offset calibration workflow
  - Check `OFFSET_READ` values
- For PWM amplitude problems:
  - Retune `PWMCONF`
  - Verify `PWM_SCALE` feedback

## Advanced Diagnostics

- For short circuit errors (`s2ga`, `s2gb`):
  - Verify MOSFETs and sense resistors
  - Inspect PCB layout and connections
- For open load detection (`olb`, `ola`):
  - Check wiring and phase connections
- For overtemperature flags (`otpw`, `ot`):
  - Reduce current
  - Improve cooling and airflow
- If stallGuard is unreliable:
  - Adjust `COOLCONF` sensitivity
  - Check mechanical load and motor condition

## Onboarding Notes

- Each troubleshooting step is cross-linked to relevant workflows and register documentation.
- For detailed procedures, see [Workflow Index](workflow_index.md).
- For stepwise configuration, see [Quick Config Workflows](TMC2160_Quick_Config_Workflows.md).
- For register details, see [Register Index](register_index.md) and [Register Field Reference](TMC2160_RegisterField_Reference.md).
- For math-based validation, see [Math Formulas](math_formulas.md).
