# TMC2160 Onboarding Guide

A modular, cross-referenced guide for understanding and using the TMC2160 stepper driver.

## Structure

- Register Index: All registers, addresses, and cross-references
- Workflow Index: Stepwise procedures and configuration flows
- Math Formulas: All relevant calculations in LaTeX
- Troubleshooting Checklist: Error handling and validation steps

## Navigation

- Each section cross-links to relevant registers, workflows, and formulas
- Register and field names are highlighted with backticks
- Technical chapters and datasheet segments are referenced for deeper dives
- For stepwise configuration, see [Quick Config Workflows](TMC2160_Quick_Config_Workflows.md)
- For detailed register field info, see [Register Field Reference](TMC2160_RegisterField_Reference.md)

(Expand with onboarding notes, technical summaries, and practical integration advice.)

## Onboarding Notes

- This guide is designed for both new and experienced users of the TMC2160 stepper driver.
- All register and field names are highlighted with backticks for easy cross-referencing.
- For a full register list, see [Register Index](register_index.md).
- For stepwise configuration and usage, see [Workflow Index](workflow_index.md).
- For all relevant formulas and calculations, see [Math Formulas](math_formulas.md).
- For troubleshooting and validation, see [Troubleshooting Checklist](troubleshooting_checklist.md).

---

## Technical Summaries

- **Register Mapping:**
  - Each register is documented with address, function, and cross-references to workflows and technical chapters.
  - Example: `CHOPCONF` controls chopper configuration, referenced in tuning and troubleshooting workflows.
- **Workflow Extraction:**
  - Key workflows (auto-tuning, chopper setup, error handling) are mapped stepwise and cross-linked to relevant registers.
- **Math Integration:**
  - All configuration and timing formulas are rendered in LaTeX for clarity and onboarding.
- **Troubleshooting:**
  - Modular checklists guide error flag interpretation and configuration validation.

## Practical Integration Advice

- Start with the [Register Index](register_index.md) to understand available configuration options.
- Use the [Workflow Index](workflow_index.md) to follow recommended setup and tuning procedures.
- Reference [Math Formulas](math_formulas.md) for precise register value calculations.
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Checklist](troubleshooting_checklist.md) if issues arise during setup or operation.
- Cross-reference technical chapters and datasheet segments for deeper understanding and advanced use cases.

---

## Next Steps

- Expand each section with detailed examples, technical notes, and cross-links as new workflows and register details are added.
- Maintain modularity and traceability for onboarding, troubleshooting, and advanced integration.

---

## Modular Workflow Navigation

- Workflows are organized by setup, tuning, diagnostics, and advanced integration.
- Cascade through workflows for onboarding, troubleshooting, and optimization.
- Advanced workflows cover edge cases, external clock setup, custom microstepping, and energy efficiency.
- All workflows are cross-linked to registers and formulas for technical depth.

---

## Advanced Onboarding Notes

- For edge cases and rare error conditions, always consult the troubleshooting checklist and validate register settings with math formulas.
- Document any custom hardware setups or non-standard configurations for future onboarding and diagnostics.
- Use the workflow index as a living documentâ€”expand with new workflows and technical notes as features and use cases evolve.

---

## Expanded Technical Summaries

- Advanced workflows include diagnostics, external clock setup, custom microstepping, and energy efficiency. All are cross-linked for traceability.

---

## Practical Integration Advice (Advanced)

- For advanced integration, combine workflows (e.g., motion control + diagnostics + energy efficiency) and validate with cross-referenced registers and formulas.
- Always log configuration changes, error recovery steps, and calibration results for traceability.
- Use onboarding notes and troubleshooting checklist to accelerate setup and minimize downtime.
