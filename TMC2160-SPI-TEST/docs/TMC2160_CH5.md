# TMC2160 Datasheet Chapter 5: Register Mapping

This chapter gives an overview of the complete register set. Some of the registers bundling a number of single bits are detailed in extra tables. The functional practical application of the settings is detailed in dedicated chapters.

**Note:**

- All registers become reset to 0 upon power up, unless otherwise noted.
- Add 0x80 to the address Addr for write accesses!

## Notation

- Hexadecimal numbers: `0x` (e.g., `0x04`)
- Multi-bit binary numbers: `%` (e.g., `%100`)
- R/W field:
  - `R`: Read only
  - `W`: Write only
  - `R/W`: Read and writable register
  - `R+C`: Clear upon read
