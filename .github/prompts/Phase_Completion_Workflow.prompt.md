# Copilot Phase Completion Workflow Prompt

Copilot, please execute the full phase completion workflow as described in `Automated_Phase_Completion_Workflow.md`.

For each workflow step:

1. Announce the step number and its purpose, as defined in the workflow document.
2. Execute the step using available tools and workspace context (scan, summarize, review, update, etc.).
3. Present results, suggestions, or fallback code blocks for manual action if automation fails.
4. Explicitly prompt for user confirmation, edits, or input before continuing.
5. Repeat until all steps are complete and a final report is presented.

Always follow the latest step numbering and instructions in the workflow document. If the workflow document is updated, use the new step numbers and instructions.

Begin with "Step 1". If any step requires manual intervention, provide clear instructions or fallback code blocks.
