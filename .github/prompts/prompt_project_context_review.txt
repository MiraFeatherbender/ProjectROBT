Review Project_Context.md as a comprehensive onboarding guide for collaborators and AI assistants.
- For each major section (Development Environment, Hardware Overview, Project Structure, Communication Interfaces, Persistent Storage, Coding Style & Preferences, Testing & Debugging, Known Issues & Checklist, Recent Changes & Current Focus, How to Run/Build, Command Reference, Migration & Goals Reference), check for clarity, completeness, and relevance.
- Assess the onboarding flow: Is it logical, welcoming, and does it answer “What do I do first?” and “Where do I find things?”
- Verify that troubleshooting tips and the compiler error checklist are clear and easy to find.
- Check for consistency and cross-references between README.md, Project_Context.md, and Goals_And_Steps.md.
- Suggest improvements for onboarding experience, documentation quality, formatting, and accessibility for advanced users and maintainers.
- Highlight any missing information or unclear instructions for new users.
- Suggest concrete edits or additions for onboarding clarity.
- Identify any technical gaps or outdated sections and recommend updates.
