Step 1 (Reviewer mode):
Quickly analyze Goals_And_Steps.md, Project_Context.md, and README.md for consistency with current code and features. Generate a concise guideline listing outdated sections, inconsistencies, and suggested updates, organized by major section (features, hardware, usage, calibration, AT commands, goals, next steps, troubleshooting, onboarding). This guideline should be formatted for agent mode to use as a checklist for a deep, interactive review and update process.

Step 2 (Agent mode):
Use the reviewer guideline to systematically review, update, and align all documentation files. For each item, prompt for user confirmation, edits, or input before making changes. Ensure all documentation matches the current workflow, project goals, terminology, formatting, cross-references, and recent changes. Present fallback code blocks for manual action if automation fails.
