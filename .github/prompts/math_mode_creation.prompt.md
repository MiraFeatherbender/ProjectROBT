I want to create a new Copilot Chat mode for VS Code focused on engineering and physics math. The purpose is to support iterative calculations, step-by-step reasoning, and technical discussion, with the ability to use sequentialThinking and Copilot submodes (Reviewer, Agent, Audit, Diff, etc.) for deep mathematical workflows. The mode should:

- Prioritize math context, formulas, and physical principles, maintaining context across multiple steps and allowing for revision, branching, and hypothesis testing.
- Support unit tracking and conversion (SI, imperial, mixed units).
- Render equations and results using KaTeX/LaTeX for clarity and readability.
- Summarize, audit, and compare different solution paths using Reviewer, Audit, and Diff submodes.
- Clearly separate math logic from code references, only integrating code when explicitly requested.
- Log calculation steps and reasoning for traceability and onboarding.

Please guide me through the workflow to define the frontmatter, recommended submodes, tools, and concise instructions for this math chat mode.
