description: Convert full-page PNGs (from PDF) into structured markdown documentation by transcribing readable content, organizing chapters, and generating math-ready markdown. Supports TOC analysis, chapter grouping, math section preparation, circuit diagram handling, workflow checklists, table conversion, and user review at key steps. Produces a summary index linking all chapters. Workflow leverages tandem modes and sequentialThinking for robust, modular, and user-guided conversion.

# PDF-to-Markdown Chat Mode Workflow

## 1. TOC Transcription & Chapter Grouping  
**Mode:** Reviewer-then-Audit-then-Agent with sequentialThinking  
- Transcribe the table of contents from the first PNG(s) containing TOC.
- SequentialThinking analyzes TOC structure, proposes chapter boundaries, and lists PNGs by chapter.
- Agent copies PNGs into chapter-named subfolders.
- User reviews and confirms chapter grouping before proceeding.

## 2. Chapter Processing (Sequentially, One Chapter at a Time)  
**Mode:** Reviewer-then-Agent-then-Diff with sequentialThinking  
- Reviewer previews chapter PNGs, identifies content types (text, math, diagrams, tables, workflows, ambiguous pages).
- SequentialThinking ensures logical order and context management.
- Agent extracts and converts content:
  - Text: Transcribed and formatted in markdown.
  - Math: Transcribed with LaTeX, notes for later notebook conversion, links to PNGs.
  - Circuit Diagrams: Cropped and embedded if possible; otherwise, link to PNG with cropping note.
  - Tables: Large tables as collapsible sections; small tables as both markdown and collapsible, user selects format.
  - Workflows: Converted to markdown checklists.
  - Ambiguous pages: Flagged for manual review, with chat mode’s interpretation.
- Diff mode presents before/after markdown for user review and approval.

## 3. Math Section Handling  
**Mode:** Reviewer-then-Agent with sequentialThinking  
- Reviewer identifies math-heavy sections and key variables.
- Agent generates math-focused markdown with LaTeX, notes for notebook conversion, and PNG links.
- SequentialThinking ensures all math content is captured and organized for later conversion.
- **Reminder:** Frequently monitor context size and token usage during math-heavy sections. If formulas or variable lists are verbose, use sequentialThinking to split into manageable steps and prevent overflow.

## 4. Table Conversion
**Mode:** sequentialThinking with Reviewer-then-Audit-then-Agent

### Enhanced Table Conversion Algorithm
1. **Section Boundary Detection**
   - Split tables by register, bit group, and logical sub-blocks (description, options, formulas, ranges, notes).
2. **Verbatim Transcription**
   - Transcribe all field names, status flags, and comments exactly as shown. No paraphrasing or reformatting of technical terms.
3. **Math and Range Extraction**
   - Identify and extract all math expressions, ranges, and units. Present formulas in LaTeX or clear markdown, separate from descriptive text.
4. **Option List Parsing**
   - For fields with multiple options, split each into its own bullet or sub-section.
5. **Multi-line Description Handling**
   - Detect and merge consecutive lines that logically belong to the same value.
   - Use context clues (e.g., indentation or formatting) to associate descriptions with values.
6. **Special Formatting for Notes**
   - Highlight “Attention”, “Hint”, “Reset Default”, and similar notes in bold or colored markdown for visibility.
7. **Recursive Splitting**
   - If a comment block contains more than one logical type, recursively split until each is isolated for accurate transcription.
8. **Validation Step**
   - Include a final check to ensure all values are accounted for and tied to their descriptions.
9. **User Confirmation Loop**
   - After splitting and transcribing each sub-block, present for user review before assembling the final markdown.
10. **Error Pattern Feedback**
    - Log and address recurring error types for future prevention.
11. **Reminder:** During table conversion, frequently monitor context size and token usage. For large or verbose tables, use sequentialThinking to split transcription into smaller steps and prevent overflow.

## 5. Ambiguous Page Handling  
**Mode:** Reviewer-then-Audit  
- Reviewer flags ambiguous PNGs, provides interpretation.
- Audit mode logs ambiguity, prompts user for manual review and resolution.

## 6. Summary Index Creation  
**Mode:** Agent-then-Auto-Fix  
- Agent generates a markdown index linking all chapter files.
- Auto-Fix mode standardizes formatting and checks for broken links.

## 7. User Review Integration  
**Mode:** Reviewer-then-Agent at each logical step  
- Reviewer presents results, Agent applies edits based on feedback.

## 8. Error Logging & Audit  
**Mode:** Audit after each major step  
- Logs issues, tracks user interventions, and suggests workflow improvements.

## 9. SequentialThinking Integration  
- At TOC analysis: Ensures chapters are correctly identified and grouped.
- At chapter start: Maintains context, prevents overflow, and tracks progress.
- At math section identification: Ensures all formulas and variables are captured.
- At table/workflow conversion: Ensures correct format selection and user choice.
- At ambiguous page handling: Ensures all ambiguities are logged and resolved.

## Ultra-Granular Transcription Mode
- For technical tables (e.g., register maps), enable stepwise, bit-by-bit or line-by-line transcription.
- After each step, pause for user confirmation and correction before proceeding.

## Verbatim Fidelity Enforcement
- Always transcribe field names and comments verbatim from the source for technical documentation.
- Avoid paraphrasing, summarization, or omission.

## Bit Order & Grouping
- For register tables, always match the bit ordering as presented in the source register documentation (do not assume descending or ascending; follow the datasheet exactly).
- Group multi-bit fields as per datasheet conventions.

## Correction & Confirmation Loop
- After each granular transcription, present the result for user review.
- Only proceed after explicit user confirmation.

## Context & Token Management
- Frequently monitor context size and token usage during verbose or granular tasks.
- Use sequentialThinking to generate split plans and break transcription into manageable steps, ensuring the overall goal is achieved without overflow.

## Error Pattern Feedback
- Audit mode should summarize recurring errors and feed them into Reviewer/Agent steps for prevention.

## Adaptive Mode Switching
- If repeated errors or user frustration are detected, switch to ultra-granular, confirmation-driven mode automatically.
