# Leg Controller Stepper Feature Development Instructions

## Purpose

Guidance for developing and integrating stepper motor features in the Leg Controller project.

## Incremental Development and Testing

- Use test modules and serial print statements to validate logic and hardware interactions before implementing full methods.
- Prototype new features or hardware routines with simple, traceable outputs to the serial console.
- Replace placeholders and test code with robust implementations as each stage of the feature is validated.
- Document test results and observations in code comments or project notes for future reference.

## Coding Style & Preferences

- Focus on integration points between new stepper modules and existing logic.
- Maintain modularity and clear separation of hardware, configuration, and logic.
- Document new commands, parameters, and expected behaviors.
- Update state machine logic and calibration pipeline as needed.

## Collaboration & Review

- Use feature branches for stepper integration and regular merges to main.
- Summarize changes in documentation after major feature additions.
- Prefer concise, actionable feedback and suggestions.
- Note if changes impact other modules or require updates elsewhere in the codebase or docs.

## Documentation

- Prompt for updating Project_Context.md, Goals_And_Steps.md, and onboarding guides after stepper feature integration.
- Ensure new features and changes are reflected in onboarding and command reference docs.
