# Leg Controller Refactor Instructions

## Purpose

Guidance for code cleanup, refactoring, and modularity improvements in the Leg Controller project.

## Coding Style & Preferences

- Focus on modularity, maintainability, and simplification of logic.
- Remove dead code and unused functions.
- Split large files into smaller, focused modules.
- Rename variables/functions for clarity and consistency.
- Update comments and docstrings to reflect refactored logic.

## Collaboration & Review

- Require updating documentation and onboarding guides after major refactors.
- Summarize changes in documentation after code cleanup.
- Prefer concise, actionable feedback and suggestions.
- Note if changes impact other modules or require updates elsewhere in the codebase or docs.
- Encourage use of feature branches for refactors.

## Documentation

- Prompt for updating Project_Context.md and Goals_And_Steps.md after major refactors.
- Ensure onboarding guides reflect new code structure and logic.
- Archive old instruction files and keep only the latest active set.
