# ROBT Leg Controller (Continuous ADC)

Firmware for the ESP32-C3-based robotic wheeled leg, designed for use in a 6-legged disability aid rover.  
Provides robust, safe, and precise steering and drive control with automatic calibration and feedback.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**
2. **Install dependencies:**
    - [ESP32 Arduino core](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) (for Arduino IDE)
3. **Open `ROBT_Leg_Controller_Continuous_ADC.ino` in Arduino IDE**
4. **Select the ESP32-C3 board and correct port**
5. **Build and upload the code**

---

## Usage

- On boot, the firmware waits for a valid ADC sample, captures the initial servo angle, and enters normal operation.
- The servo is controlled via the `LegSupervisor` and `ServoController` classes.
- Pin modes and assignments are configured in `DriveConfig.h`.
- Hall sensor and magnet sweep logic enable automatic calibration and backlash compensation.

---

## Calibration

- The system captures the initial angle from the servo’s potentiometer at startup.
- Dual-edge hall sensor logic enables precise calibration using neodymium magnets.
- Backlash compensation is applied automatically.
