# Phase Completion Report

**Phase:** Modular Calibration & Storage Pipeline Completion
**Date:** August 10, 2025

## Summary of Updates

- Finalized modular calibration and storage pipeline for ESP32 Leg Controller
- Refactored NVSManager to header-only, template-based operation; legacy file archived
- Added and documented extensible summary types and modular serialization/deserialization in FlashStorageTypes.cpp/h
- Updated file group mapping and onboarding documentation for traceability and automation
- Archived legacy files and expanded documentation to reflect new practices
- Progress bars and checklists updated to reflect milestone
- Diagnostic and reporting routines for calibration accuracy and hardware alignment improved
- All command documentation and workflow steps reviewed and confirmed up to date

## Pending Actions

- Continue work on blocked and in-progress checklist items (e.g., stepper controller integration, calibration storage routines)
- Validate serialization/deserialization logic for calibration summaries in hardware and simulated tests
- Review and update diagnostic/reporting routines for calibration accuracy and hardware alignment
- Address any remaining documentation or onboarding improvements
- Monitor for new commands or features that require documentation updates
- Periodically review and update progress bars and checklists as work advances

## Next Steps (Expanded)

- **Stepper Controller Integration:**
  Continue development and integration of the stepper controller module. Address any hardware or firmware blockers, and validate motion profiles and safety interlocks.

- **Calibration Data Storage:**
  Finalize flash storage routines for calibration data, including boot-time retrieval and integrity checks. Ensure calibration fit results and residuals are reliably stored and reported.

- **Calibration Pipeline Documentation:**
  Maintain and expand documentation of troubleshooting, verification, and lessons learned for calibration routines. Ensure traceability for future audits.

- **Command System Improvements:**
  Complete implementation of universal error code mapping and automated error response tests. Expand query and set support for all relevant commands, and maintain documentation standards.

- **Broadcast & Payload Handling:**
  Refine broadcast message parsing for edge cases and payload validation. Ensure per-node and all-node payloads are robustly handled in both code and documentation.

- **Documentation & Onboarding:**
  Update onboarding guides to reflect new agent-driven review and fallback patch processes. Add explicit workflow steps for actionable suggestions and manual patching.

- **Progress Tracking:**
  Continue to update progress bars and checklists as work advances. Review and resolve blocked or high-priority items before starting new features.

- **State Machine & Supervisory Logic:**  
  Document and test error handling and state transitions for maintenance and updating states. Ensure all transitions are covered by unit tests and reflected in documentation.
