# Calibration Pipeline Completion Report

**Date:** August 10, 2025

## Summary of Updates

- Calibration pipeline phase completed and merged:
  - Troubleshooting, verification, and documentation finalized for calibration routines
  - Key fixes and lessons learned summarized in code and markdown
  - Serial diagnostics and validation logic confirmed
  - Checklist and progress bars updated to reflect milestone
- Progress bars and stats have been updated to reflect current project status
- Goals and next steps have been reviewed, clarified, and reorganized for consistency
- Obsolete commands (`SERVO_CAL`, `VERIFY_NVS`) have been transitioned to `CAL`/`CAL?` and checklist entries updated
- Command documentation has been reviewed and confirmed to match the codebase; no discrepancies found
- Section headers have been differentiated for clarity (Goals/Next Steps)
- All active commands and workflow steps are documented and up to date

## Pending Actions

- Continue work on blocked and in-progress checklist items (e.g., stepper controller integration, calibration storage routines)
- Address any remaining documentation or onboarding improvements
- Monitor for new commands or features that require documentation updates
- Periodically review and update progress bars and checklists as work advances

## Next Steps (Expanded)

- **Stepper Controller Integration:**
  Continue development and integration of the stepper controller module. Address any hardware or firmware blockers, and validate motion profiles and safety interlocks.

- **Calibration Data Storage:**
  Finalize flash storage routines for calibration data, including boot-time retrieval and integrity checks. Ensure calibration fit results and residuals are reliably stored and reported.

- **Calibration Pipeline Documentation:**
  Maintain and expand documentation of troubleshooting, verification, and lessons learned for calibration routines. Ensure traceability for future audits.

- **Command System Improvements:**
  Complete implementation of universal error code mapping and automated error response tests. Expand query and set support for all relevant commands, and maintain documentation standards.

- **Broadcast & Payload Handling:**
  Refine broadcast message parsing for edge cases and payload validation. Ensure per-node and all-node payloads are robustly handled in both code and documentation.

- **Documentation & Onboarding:**
  Update onboarding guides to reflect new agent-driven review and fallback patch processes. Add explicit workflow steps for actionable suggestions and manual patching.

- **Progress Tracking:**
  Continue to update progress bars and checklists as work advances. Review and resolve blocked or high-priority items before starting new features.

- **State Machine & Supervisory Logic:**  
  Document and test error handling and state transitions for maintenance and updating states. Ensure all transitions are covered by unit tests and reflected in documentation.
