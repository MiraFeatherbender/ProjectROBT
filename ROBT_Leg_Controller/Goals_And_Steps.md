## Goals

- [ ] Integrate servo calibration triggers into custom AT command interface
- [ ] Integrate servo and stepper motion into custom AT command interface
    - [ ] Include target servo angle, target stepper velocity, transition time
- [ ] Add flash storage for calibration data, including center pulse time and backlash offset
    - [ ] Add "SweepProfile" struct to calibration for storage
- [ ] Ensure boot-time retrieval of calibration data from flash
- [ ] Replace static LEDC fade time calculation with parameterized slew time

## Next Steps

- [ ] Implement flash write and read routines for calibration data
    - [ ] NVS based. Use "SweepProfile"
- [x] Move "SweepProfile" to independent "FlashStorageTypes.h"
- [ ] Implement SweepProfile transfer flow:
    - [‚è≥] ServoCalibration creates SweepSummary
    - [‚è≥] LegSupervisor relays SweepSummary via its own getter
    - [‚è≥] NVSManager pulls SweepSummary from LegSupervisor to store in flash
- [ ] Draft NVSManager.cpp
- [ ] Test boot-time retrieval of calibration data
- [ ] Prototype optional "calibrating" state in bootstate machine
