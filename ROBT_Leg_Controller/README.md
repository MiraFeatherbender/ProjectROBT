## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**
2. **Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code**
3. **Install and configure the Arduino Extension**
4. **Open `ROBT_Leg_Controller.ino` in VS Code**
5. **Select the Nologo ESP32-C3 Super Mini board and correct port**
6. **Click Upload to flash via USB (OTA update planned)**
7. **Use the Serial Monitor at 115200 baud for debugging**

_Arduino IDE is supported as a secondary method._

## Usage

- On boot, the firmware waits for a valid ADC sample, captures the initial servo angle, and enters normal operation.
- The servo is controlled via the `LegSupervisor` and `ServoController` classes.
- Pin modes and assignments are configured in `DriveConfig.h`.
- Hall sensor and magnet sweep logic enable automatic calibration and backlash compensation.

---

## Calibration

- The system captures the initial angle from the servo’s potentiometer at startup.
- Dual-edge hall sensor logic enables precise calibration using neodymium magnets.
- Backlash compensation is applied automatically.

## File Overview

The project is organized into modular C++ files for clarity and maintainability. Key files include:

- `ROBT_Leg_Controller.ino` – Main sketch and state machine
- `DriveConfig.h` – Hardware and configuration structs
- `LegSupervisor.cpp/h` – High-level leg/servo management
- `SerialInputHandler.cpp/h` – Serial input buffering and callback pipeline
- `CommandParser.cpp/h` – Serial/ESP-NOW AT command parsing and dispatch
- `CommandFactory.cpp/h` – Centralized AT command registration and mode-differentiated handler sets
- `CommandDispatcher.cpp/h` – Dispatches commands using handler sets from CommandFactory
- `HallSensorHandler.cpp/h` – Hall sensor and magnet sweep logic
- `ServoController.cpp/h` – Servo control logic
- `ServoCalibration.cpp/h` – Servo calibration logic and summary generation
- `FlashStorageTypes.h/cpp` – Modular data structures and serialization for flash storage (new)
- `NVSManager.h` – Header-only, template-based flash storage and calibration data management (legacy `NVSManager.cpp` archived)
- `docs/archive/` – Archived legacy files and milestone reports for traceability

All logic is separated into `.cpp/.h` modules for hardware abstraction and maintainability.
