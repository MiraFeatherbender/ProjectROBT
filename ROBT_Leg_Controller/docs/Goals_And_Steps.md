## Task State Legend

- [ ] Not started
- [⏳] In progress
- [😰] In progress (stuck or stressful)
- [🧩] Blocked / Needs input
- [🚩] Needs attention / High priority
- [x] Complete

---

## Goals
- [x] Implement hardware-based node addressing via address pins (unified firmware for all legs)
- [x] Support advanced broadcast AT command payloads with per-node and all-node parameter blocks
- [⏳] Document and maintain example formats for AT command payloads (unicast and broadcast)
- [x] Ensure command parser is modular and future-proof for new command types and parameter formats
- [x] Refactor command processing to strip AT+ from cmd.command and parse '='/'?' into a cmd.type field (set/query)
- [⏳] Integrate servo and stepper motion into custom AT command interface
- [⏳] Add flash storage for calibration data, including center pulse time and backlash offset
- [⏳] Replace static LEDC fade time calculation with parameterized slew time
- [⏳] Migrate ESP-NOW and OTAUpdater from anchor node codebase (serial command interface complete; see [migration plan](./ESP-NOW_Command_OTA_Migration_Plan.md))
- [x] Implement interlocks: E-stop overrides all, calibration blocks movement, and both require specific states/modes
- [x] Restrict access to critical commands in maintenance mode
    - [x] Only allow entering maintenance mode when safely parked
- [⏳] Ensure all command responses are terse, consistent, and include error codes
    - [⏳] Ensure query responses are always in a consistent, parseable format
- [⏳] Define and document a `LegControllerCommandMap` for all supported commands
    - [⏳] Ensure all commands use consistent parameter mapping and error code conventions
    - [⏳] Maintain a central documentation standard for each command (name, parameters, responses, error codes)

---

## Next Steps
- [x] Test and validate broadcast message parsing for:
    - [x] Per-node payloads (e.g., `N11,42,99,|`)
    - [x] All-node payloads (no node tags)
    - [x] Edge cases (missing node, empty payload, malformed input)
- [x] Add or update unit tests for `parseParams` and `filterNodeParams`
- [⏳] Document AT command and broadcast payload formats in code and docs
- [x] Review and refactor other modules (e.g., LegSupervisor, NVSManager) for compatibility with new command parser logic

- [ ] Implement flash write and read routines for calibration data
    - [ ] NVS based. Use "SweepProfile"
    - [ ] Test boot-time retrieval of calibration data
    - [x] Move "SweepProfile" to independent "FlashStorageTypes.h"
    - [⏳] Implement SweepProfile transfer flow:
        - [⏳] ServoCalibration creates SweepSummary
        - [⏳] LegSupervisor relays SweepSummary to NVSManager via getter
        - [⏳] NVSManager accepts SweepSummary from LegSupervisor to store in flash

- [ ] Add physical reset switch for E-Stop state
    - [ ] Measure pins 8 and 9 for boot state

- [⏳] Implement AT command handlers
    - [x] MOVE command handler
    - [⏳] SMOOTH_STOP command handler
    - [⏳] E_STOP command handler
    - [⏳] SERVO_CAL command handler
    - [⏳] VERIFY_NVS command handler
    - [⏳] PARK command handler
    - [⏳] NODE command handler
    - [⏳] OTA command handler

- [ ] Refactor boot logic from *begin() to state machine
    - [ ] Servo startup position belongs in homing state

- [ ] Implement HOME command for external use and internal self injection

- [x] Prototype SystemState state machine in LegSupervisor
    - [⏳] Implement Booting state
    - [⏳] Implement Parked state
    - [⏳] Implement Stopped state
    - [x] Implement ProcessMoveCMD state
    - [x] Implement Moving state
    - [⏳] Implement Calibrating state
    - [⏳] Implement EStop state
    - [⏳] Implement Maintenance state
    - [⏳] Implement Updating state

- [x] Implement and test serial AT command input and parsing pipeline (now supports robust unicast and broadcast parsing)

- [x] Add or adapt commands specific to leg controller functionality (e.g., calibration, diagnostics)
    - [x] Update documentation and code comments for new/changed commands and error codes
    - [ ] Add diagnostic/test commands for hardware and storage modules
    - [ ] Integrate servo calibration triggers into custom AT command interface

- [ ] Write unit tests for command dispatcher and registration logic

- [ ] Implement dynamic command registration in CommandDispatcher (optional)

- [ ] Develop mock modules for test builds
