## Goals
- [ ] Support advanced broadcast AT command payloads with per-node and all-node parameter blocks
- [ ] Document and maintain example formats for AT command payloads (unicast and broadcast)
- [ ] Ensure command parser is modular and future-proof for new command types and parameter formats
- [ ] Integrate servo calibration triggers into custom AT command interface
- [ ] Integrate servo and stepper motion into custom AT command interface
    - [ ] Include target servo angle, target stepper velocity, transition time
- [ ] Add flash storage for calibration data, including center pulse time and backlash offset
    - [ ] Add "SweepProfile" struct to calibration for storage
- [ ] Ensure boot-time retrieval of calibration data from flash
- [ ] Replace static LEDC fade time calculation with parameterized slew time
- [‚è≥] Migrate ESP-NOW and OTAUpdater from anchor node codebase (serial command interface complete; see [migration plan](./ESP-NOW_Command_OTA_Migration_Plan.md))

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test and validate broadcast message parsing for:
    - [ ] Per-node payloads (e.g., `N11,42,99,|`)
    - [ ] All-node payloads (no node tags)
    - [ ] Edge cases (missing node, empty payload, malformed input)
- [ ] Add or update unit tests for `parseParams` and `filterNodeParams`
- [ ] Document AT command and broadcast payload formats in code and docs
- [ ] Review and refactor other modules (e.g., LegSupervisor, NVSManager) for compatibility with new command parser logic

- [ ] Implement flash write and read routines for calibration data
    - [ ] NVS based. Use "SweepProfile"
- [x] Move "SweepProfile" to independent "FlashStorageTypes.h"
- [ ] Implement SweepProfile transfer flow:
    - [‚è≥] ServoCalibration creates SweepSummary
    - [‚è≥] LegSupervisor relays SweepSummary to NVSManager via getter
    - [‚è≥] NVSManager accepts SweepSummary from LegSupervisor to store in flash
- [x] Draft NVSManager.cpp
- [ ] Test boot-time retrieval of calibration data
- [ ] Prototype optional "calibrating" state in bootstate machine
    - [‚è≥] Implement and test serial AT command input and parsing pipeline (now supports robust unicast and broadcast parsing)
