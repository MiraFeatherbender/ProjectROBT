## Task State Legend

- [ ] Not started
- [⏳] In progress
- [😰] In progress (stuck or stressful)
- [🧩] Blocked / Needs input
- [🚩] Needs attention / High priority
- [x] Complete

---

**Branching Guidelines**

- Create a branch for any major feature, refactor, or experimental change that:
    - Will take more than a short session to complete
    - Might impact stability or require testing/review
    - Involves architectural changes, new modules, or hardware integration
- Suggested branch naming: `feature/stepper-controller`, `refactor/homing-logic`, `docs/command-updates`, etc.
- Merge back to main only after testing and review.

## Goals

**Control Dynamics & Hardware**
- [x] Implement hardware-based node addressing via address pins (unified firmware for all legs)
- [x] Support advanced broadcast AT command payloads with per-node and all-node parameter blocks
- [ ] Implement stepper controller module 🔀
- [⏳] Integrate servo and stepper motion into custom AT command interface 🔀
- [x] Replace static LEDC fade time calculation with parameterized slew time
    - [x] Refactor fade time logic in ServoController to accept direct values from commands, shifting safety responsibility to command logic
    - [ ] Ensure Drive Coordinator project implements angular steering velocity safety checks to prevent unsafe servo

**Command System & Parser**
- [x] Ensure command parser is modular and future-proof for new command types and parameter formats
- [x] Refactor command processing to strip AT+ from cmd.command and parse '='/'?' into a cmd.type field (set/query)
- [⏳] Define and document a `LegControllerCommandMap` for all supported commands 🔀
    - [⏳] Ensure all commands use consistent parameter mapping and error code conventions
    - [⏳] Maintain a central documentation standard for each command (name, parameters, responses, error codes)
- [ ] Ensure command handlers support modular differentiation of action, set, and query modes, following AT command conventions 🔀

**Calibration & Storage**
- [⏳] Add flash storage for calibration data, including center pulse time and backlash offset 🔀

**Safety & Interlocks**
- [x] Implement interlocks: E-stop overrides all, calibration blocks movement, and both require specific states/modes
- [x] Restrict access to critical commands in maintenance mode
    - [x] Only allow entering maintenance mode when safely parked

**Communications & Migration**
- [⏳] Migrate ESP-NOW and OTAUpdater from anchor node codebase (serial command interface complete; see [migration plan](./ESP-NOW_Command_OTA_Migration_Plan.md))

**Response Consistency**
- [⏳] Ensure all command responses are terse, consistent, and include error codes
    - [⏳] Ensure query responses are always in a consistent, parseable format
