## Task State Legend

- [ ] Not started
- [⏳] In progress
- [😰] In progress (stuck or stressful)
- [🧩] Blocked / Needs input
- [🚩] Needs attention / High priority
- [x] Complete

---

---


## Goals
- [x] Support advanced broadcast AT command payloads with per-node and all-node parameter blocks
- [⏳] Document and maintain example formats for AT command payloads (unicast and broadcast)
- [x] Ensure command parser is modular and future-proof for new command types and parameter formats
- [ ] Refactor command processing to strip AT+ from cmd.command and parse '='/'?' into a cmd.type field (set/query)
- [ ] Add unit tests for command dispatcher and registration logic
- [ ] Add diagnostic/test commands for hardware and storage modules
- [ ] Add support for dynamic command registration (future extensibility)
- [ ] Add mock modules for test builds
- [ ] Integrate servo calibration triggers into custom AT command interface
- [⏳] Integrate servo and stepper motion into custom AT command interface
    - [⏳] Include target servo angle, target stepper velocity, transition time
- [ ] Add flash storage for calibration data, including center pulse time and backlash offset
    - [⏳] Add "SweepProfile" struct to calibration for storage
- [ ] Ensure boot-time retrieval of calibration data from flash
- [ ] Replace static LEDC fade time calculation with parameterized slew time
- [⏳] Migrate ESP-NOW and OTAUpdater from anchor node codebase (serial command interface complete; see [migration plan](./ESP-NOW_Command_OTA_Migration_Plan.md))

## Next Steps
- [x] Test and validate broadcast message parsing for:
    - [x] Per-node payloads (e.g., `N11,42,99,|`)
    - [x] All-node payloads (no node tags)
    - [x] Edge cases (missing node, empty payload, malformed input)
- [x] Add or update unit tests for `parseParams` and `filterNodeParams`
- [⏳] Document AT command and broadcast payload formats in code and docs
- [x] Review and refactor other modules (e.g., LegSupervisor, NVSManager) for compatibility with new command parser logic

- [ ] Implement flash write and read routines for calibration data
    - [ ] NVS based. Use "SweepProfile"
- [x] Move "SweepProfile" to independent "FlashStorageTypes.h"
- [⏳] Implement SweepProfile transfer flow:
    - [⏳] ServoCalibration creates SweepSummary
    - [⏳] LegSupervisor relays SweepSummary to NVSManager via getter
    - [⏳] NVSManager accepts SweepSummary from LegSupervisor to store in flash
- [x] Draft NVSManager.cpp
- [ ] Test boot-time retrieval of calibration data
- [ ] Prototype optional "calibrating" state in bootstate machine
    - [x] Implement and test serial AT command input and parsing pipeline (now supports robust unicast and broadcast parsing)
