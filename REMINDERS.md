# Project Reminders

## Central Node Codebases
- Remember to upload both central node codebases to the workspace when ready to enact the migration plan:
  - The main communication and navigation codebase
  - The custom GUI codebase with overloaded serial methods
- After migration, plan to review and merge these two central node codebases for unified development and easier maintenance.

## Why?
- Having all codebases in one workspace will make it easier to:
  - Review and standardize custom command and ESP-NOW communication
  - Test end-to-end interactions
  - Refactor and merge features as needed
